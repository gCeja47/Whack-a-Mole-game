# Whack-a-Mole Game

## Description:
I created this simple text-based game for the lab 6 assignment in my Systems Programming class (CS 480 in Cal Poly Humboldt, Spring 2023 semester). I made it during April 7-12, 2023. This game is written in C and uses the ncurses library to create a text-based user interface for the game.

## Instructions:
In this game, there are some "holes" on the screen where moles can show up (a hole is represented as a 0, with a number below it to identify it). The mole is represented by an M in place of the zero for the hole. The player presses the key on their keyboard with the same number as that hole to whack the mole. The user can either gain or lose a point (down to a minimum score of zero) based on whether they chose the right number on time. The game ends when the user runs out of rounds.

## Installation:
First, you must download the .c file to your computer. Make sure you know which folder it is in, so you can know the filepath to compile and run the program. Next, you must make sure you have a terminal window program on you computer as well as a C compiler. Then, to play the game, you should open the terminal window and compile the program. Then, you can run the game in the terminal window and play it using the keyboard.
